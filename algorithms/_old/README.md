# About Tutorial Challenges

Many of the challenges on HackerRank are difficult and assume you already know the relevant algorithms very well. These tutorial challenges are different. They break down algorithmic concepts into smaller challenges, so you can learn the algorithm by doing the challenges.

These challenges are intended for people who know some programming and now want to learn some algorithms. You could be a student majoring in Computers, a self-taught programmer, or an experienced developer who wants an active algorithms review!

The first series of challenges covers sorting. These are the different challenges:

## Tutorial Challenges - Sorting

### Insertion Sort challenges

* Insertion Sort 1 - Inserting
* Insertion Sort 2 - Sorting
* Correctness of Algorithms
* Running Time of Algorithms

### Quicksort challenges

* Quicksort 1 - Partition
* Quicksort 2 - Sorting
* Quicksort In-place (advanced)
* Running time of Quicksort

### Counting sort challenges

* Counting Sort 1 - Counting
* Counting Sort 2 - Simple sort
* Counting Sort 3 - Preparing
* Full Counting Sort (advanced)

There will also be some challenges where you apply what you learned.

## About the Challenges

The challenges will describe some topic and then ask you to code a solution. As you progress through the challenges, you will learn concepts in algorithms. On each challenge, you will receive input on _STDIN_ and you will need to print the correct output to _STDOUT_.

For many challenges, helper methods will be provided for you to process the input into a useful format, like an array. You can use these methods to get started with your program, or you can write your own input methods if you want. Your code just needs to print the right output to each test case.
